#stuff to look at that might be a little odd:
#   -large distance of defenders at outcome.
#   -number of rb's and te's being 3 or more
#   -might need to rethink how wide receivers data is organized, not clear if the predictors should
#    just have the wide receivers in order or if the predictors should be for a certain area and left blank if no wide receiver in that area
