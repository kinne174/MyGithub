#build a dictionary of parameters to define what might be useful in play

#maybe first try ignoring pre snap defense stuff and just define a catchable ball by how much seperation there is and direction of defenders when ball is thrown
#then say which combination of routes works best given offense alignment (shotgun and wr positioning), time between snap and throw, deepness of the routes,

#might need to add into the model somehow how long it takes for the quarterback to get sacked depending on how many people rush/block

#can label routes success or failures depending on seperation at common release times
#
# to do for each passing play:
#   -label success based on catching the ball or 'drop', ow no success
#   -measure time between ball passed and ball caught/incomplete/intercepted. If sack do nothing
#   -measure time between ball snapped and ball passed
#   -when ball is passed the distance of the closest two defenders from the ball caught/incomplete/interception point, their direction relative to ball point and speed
#   -when ball is passed the distance of the intended wide receiver (closest one when ball is caught/incomplete/intercepted), direction and speed too
#   -distance ball caught/incomplete/intercepted is from closest sideline
#   -measure distance (pos and neg) of wide receivers from ball.
#   -depth of route up the field (interaction possibly with some time stuff?)
#   -blitz?
#   -offense personnel
#   -closest defender at pass
